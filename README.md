## Background and Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings, reviews, and availability data to uncover key trends in the rental market. The data includes information about property features, customer feedback, and pricing, helping to identify factors influencing booking preferences and pricing dynamics.

## Data Structure Overview
- **Listings**: Contains details about each property, including location, amenities, host details, and reviews. Major variables include `id`, `name`, `description`, `review_scores`, and `price`.
- **Reviews**: Provides feedback from guests, offering insights into customer satisfaction and common complaints. Key fields include `listing_id`, `reviewer_id`, `date`, and `comments`.
- **Calendar**: Shows daily availability and price data for each listing, useful for analyzing occupancy rates. Main fields are `listing_id`, `date`, `available`, and `price`.

## Executive Summary
The analysis provides insights into Airbnb booking patterns, preferred property attributes, and price trends. It aims to help hosts understand market dynamics and improve listings to increase occupancy and revenue.
